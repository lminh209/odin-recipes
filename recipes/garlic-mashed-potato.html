    <h2>
        <b>Ingredients</b>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 ½-inch pieces</li>
            <li>5 large garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>¾ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Steps</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine potatoes, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of the salt in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes and return to hot saucepan. Stir until dry, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add butter, 1 piece at a time, stirring gently until melted before the next addition.</li>
            <li>Using a potato masher, mash in milk until smooth. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer potatoes to a serving bowl and top with more butter, if desired.</li>
